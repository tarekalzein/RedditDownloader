A simple Reddit posts and comments downloader that uses pushshift.io API to get data. The API limits each API request to 1000 entries. 
This downloader shall bypass this limitation and gets requested data 1000 entries after another, untill no data is being sent from API.

Important: This application downloads specific data to make a dataset which will be used in a BA thesis at Gothenburg university.
